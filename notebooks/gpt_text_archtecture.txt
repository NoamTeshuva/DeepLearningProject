Organizing your code into separate Python files (modules) for different models and functionalities is generally a good practice in terms of code clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Having a well-structured project layout makes it easier for you (and anyone else working on the project) to understand the codebase, reuse code, and add new features without creating clutter.

Suggested Approach:

Project Root Structure: Consider a structure like this:

scss
Copy code
project/
    data/
        car/
        motorcycle/
        ...
    src/
        __init__.py
        datasets.py
        baseline.py
        logistic_regression.py
        train.py
        utils.py
    models/
        __init__.py
        my_cnn.py
        some_other_model.py
    notebooks/
        exploration.ipynb
        testing.ipynb
    requirements.txt
    README.md
    ...
Modules for Different Purposes:

baseline.py:
Contains the code for your baseline model (the constant-class predictor) and the logic to run and evaluate it.

logistic_regression.py:
Contains code for setting up, training, and evaluating your logistic regression model.

datasets.py:
Code related to loading and preparing datasets (e.g., custom Dataset classes, transforms, etc.).

train.py:
A script that orchestrates the training process. It could accept command-line arguments or configuration files to specify which model to train, which dataset to use, and other hyperparameters. For example:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --model logistic_regression --epochs 10
utils.py:
Helper functions, metrics calculation, or other utility code that can be shared across baseline.py, logistic_regression.py, and future models.

Separate Model Code (Optional):
If you have more complex models (e.g., neural networks), you might put their definitions in separate files under a models directory. For instance, my_cnn.py for your CNN architecture. Simpler models (like logistic regression) may just remain in a single Python file if theyâ€™re short, but separating them still helps keep the code organized.

Why This Structure Is Beneficial:

Maintainability:
If your baseline code is separated from logistic regression code, you can modify or debug each independently without affecting the other.

Readability:
Anyone reading your code can quickly find the baseline code in baseline.py and the logistic regression code in logistic_regression.py.

Scalability:
As your project grows, you can add more model files (like resnet.py, svm.py) and keep them organized rather than lumping everything into a single large script.

Reusability:
If you have utility functions or dataset loading code in their own files, you can reuse them for multiple models without copying and pasting code.

Testing and Notebooks:

Notebooks:
Store Jupyter notebooks in a notebooks/ directory for exploratory data analysis, quick tests, or demos.

Tests:
You might also consider adding a tests/ folder with automated tests (using pytest or similar) to ensure your code works as expected over time.

In Conclusion: Yes, it is a good idea to separate your models into different Python files. For a baseline model, use baseline.py, and for logistic regression, logistic_regression.py. This organization will make your code cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain as your project grows.
