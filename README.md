“README: Machine Learning Final Project -------------------------------------- ### Project Title: **Car vs Bike Classification** ### Overview This project is part of my Machine Learning coursework, where the goal is to classify images into two categories: **Car** and **Bike**. The dataset consists of labeled images stored in separate folders, and the project is structured to demonstrate different machine learning techniques, starting with a simple baseline model. ### Dataset * The dataset is stored in the `data/carBikeDataset` directory. * It contains two subfolders: * `Car/` for car images * `Bike/` for bike images * The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of images in each class. ### Baseline Model The first step in this project is creating a baseline model. This model: * Always predicts the majority class (in this case, "Bike"). * Metrics are calculated to evaluate its performance: * Accuracy: 50% * Precision (for "Bike"): 50% * Recall (for "Bike"): 100%”
